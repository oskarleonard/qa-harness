# qa-harness — agent-driven QA engines (iOS simulator + web)

Reusable "eyes & hands" for an AI agent that **operates your running app**:
reads the live accessibility tree, taps/clicks by label, screenshots, hunts
bugs, verifies its own fixes, and asserts backend ground truth the screen
can't show. No pre-written test scripts — the agent explores; these engines
are its deterministic mechanics.

One clone per machine serves every project. Fix a harness bug once, here —
every project picks it up on the next `git pull`. That replaces the old
copy-per-project workflow where improvements died in whichever repo got them.

## The layering contract

The engine is **product-agnostic**. Everything project-specific lives in the
project, layered over the engine through four well-known places in the
project's qa dir (`scripts/sim-qa/` for mobile, `scripts/qa/` for web):

| Layer | File(s) | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **Pin** | `target.py` (+ gitignored `target.local`) — sim/port/bundle/mode env, server cmd | yes |
| **Ground truth & product brain** | `product/` — `qa_api.py` (`qa check/snapshot/diff`), `INVARIANTS.md`, `FIGMA_MAP.md`, `RUNBOOK.md` addendum (modes, rails, scopes) | no |
| **Project commands** | `ext/<name>{,.py,.sh}` — any extra subcommand (`qa <name>`), e.g. an autoplay layer for timed gameplay | no |
| **Output** | `runs/` (gitignored) | auto |

`product/qa_api.py` owns *whatever* the project's ground truth is — a local
REST backend, SQLite, a state-store dump. The engine only defines the CLI
contract (`check`, `snapshot --out f`, `diff f [--expect-new N]`); without the
file, those commands no-op with a notice.

A team can also keep the product layer in a dedicated repo (e.g. a central
QA-scenario repo) and point `product/` at that checkout — the engine doesn't
care where the dir comes from.

## Install (once per machine)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oskarleonard/qa-harness ~/programming/projects/qa-harness
```

Projects resolve the harness in this order:
1. `QA_HARNESS_DIR` env var
2. `~/.qa-harness` — a one-line file containing the path
3. `~/programming/projects/qa-harness` (default)

If you cloned elsewhere: `echo /path/to/qa-harness > ~/.qa-harness`.

## Onboard a project (minutes)

1. Copy the shim: `templates/shim-mobile` → `<project>/scripts/sim-qa/qa`
   (or `templates/shim-web` → `<project>/scripts/qa/qa`), `chmod +x`.
2. Copy `mobile/target.example.py` (or `web/`) next to it as `target.py` and
   adapt the values — see PORTING.md "Per-app values".
3. Gitignore `runs/`, `target.local`, `__pycache__/` in that dir.
4. Optional: add `product/` (start from `templates/product-README.md`) and
   `ext/`.
5. Smoke test: `qa doctor` → `qa serve` → `qa health` → (mobile) `qa tree`.

PORTING.md has the full recipe plus the empirical gotchas that cost a day
each if rediscovered.

## Rules of the repo

- **Nothing product-specific lands here.** Litmus test for every line:
  *would this still make sense for a completely different app?* App names,
  URLs, scope lists, invariant rules, Figma nodes → the project's `product/`.
- **Fix here, not in a project.** If a bug is found mid-QA-run in some
  project, the fix belongs in this repo (commit + push), so every other
  project inherits it.
- Engines per platform stay separate (`mobile/` vs `web/` — different
  mechanics); genuinely shared code goes to `common/`.
