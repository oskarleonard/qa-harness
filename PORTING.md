# Onboarding a project (and the gotchas that cost a day each)

The engines are project-agnostic; onboarding = writing the project layer.
Read the engine's `README.md` + `RUNBOOK.md` first — they carry ~80% of the
operating knowledge. This file carries the rest: what a project writes, the
per-app values, and the empirical platform gotchas.

## What a project writes vs gets for free

| Piece | Action |
|---|---|
| Engine (`mobile/core` or `web/core` + dispatcher) | **Free.** Lives in this repo; never copy it into a project. |
| `scripts/.../qa` shim + `_harness.py` | Copy both from `templates/` (never edited). |
| `target.py` | **Write per project** from `target.example.py` — the CONFIG section only; the machinery (UDID auto-resolve + `target.local` pin, `--field` CLI) comes from `common/targetkit.py`. See "Per-app values". |
| `product/` (qa_api.py + INVARIANTS.md + FIGMA_MAP.md + RUNBOOK addendum) | **Re-derive per product** — this asserts THIS app's ground truth and rails. Port the *pattern* (see "Ground-truth layer"), never the rules. |
| `ext/` | Only if the project needs extra mechanics (e.g. an autoplay layer for timed gameplay — sub-3s response windows an LLM can't keep up with live). |
| `.claude/commands/qa-tester*.md` | Thin per-project pointers: "follow the engine RUNBOOK + product/RUNBOOK.md". The Rails sections are the per-app customization point. |

## Per-app values (target.py)

Mobile:
- `DEVICE_NAME` — a sim model **no other project's tester uses** on this
  machine (parallel testers coexist by sim + port).
- `PORT` — distinct from the app's dev Metro AND every other tester.
- `BUNDLE` + `SCHEME` — from `app.config.ts` (dev-flavor bundle id; URL scheme
  for dev-client deep links).
- `TAB_ORDER` — read the live a11y tree (`qa tree`), don't guess.
- `LAUNCHER_LABELS` — strings distinctive of the Expo dev-launcher AND the
  dev-client error screen ("there was a problem loading the project",
  "failed to load app").
- `LOG_PROCESS_HINT` — substring of the app's process name (crash-log predicate).
- `/tmp/<project>-tester-*` artifact paths — **namespace per project**.
- `MODE`/`METRO_ENV` — the app's own mock/dev flags. Gotcha: Expo's dev
  transform spreads `.env*` files OVER inline env — flag vars must have NO
  `.env*` entry to propagate.
- Optional: `BACKEND_URL` (health/doctor ping it; omit/None = no backend),
  `BACKEND_HINT` (the fix command printed when it's down).

Web:
- `TESTER_PORT` — never your dev port; `APP_URL`.
- `MODE`/`MODE_ENV` — the app's msw/mock-auth envs per mode.
- `SERVER_CMD` (argv, default `["bun", "run", "dev"]`; `PORT` env is set for
  you) + `SERVER_CWD` (monorepo subdir, default repo root).
- `SERVER_LOG`/`PIDFILE` — namespace per project.
- Optional: `BACKEND_URL`/`BACKEND_HINT` as above.
- Headless: `qa shot` is always headless. The agent's live eyes are the
  Playwright MCP — toggle headless in the project's `.mcp.json` args.

### Web gotcha — Next 16 allows ONE dev server per project dir

A second `next dev` (the tester's) boots, detects the developer's instance,
and self-terminates ("Another next dev server is already running"). Fix: a
distDir env hook in the app's `next.config` —
`distDir: process.env.NEXT_DIST_DIR || ".next"` — plus
`MODE_ENV = {"NEXT_DIST_DIR": ".next-qa"}` in target.py (gitignore
`.next-qa/`). Without the hook, the tester only runs while the dev server is
down.

## Empirical gotchas — mobile/iOS (don't relearn these)

1. **idb rejects `"booted"` as a UDID** — pass the real UDID (`simctl`
   accepts the alias; `idb` errors "Cannot spawn companion for booted").
2. **Synthesized taps lose to react-native-gesture-handler** — gorhom
   backdrop-tap/drag-down never fire. Sheets need a labelled escape: an
   in-flow gorhom `TouchableOpacity` (NOT RN Pressable — a11y sees it but
   onPress never fires inside the sheet's gesture context; NOT
   position:absolute — same failure; NOT opacity:0 — iOS drops alpha=0 from
   the a11y tree). Gate it on a tester env var your `METRO_ENV` sets.
3. **Gorhom's container is accessible-by-default** (role 'adjustable') — it
   collapses ALL sheet content out of the a11y tree. `accessible={false}`
   on the container un-collapses.
4. **iOS 26 NativeTabs**: items don't appear in `describe-all` (only a 'Tab
   Bar' group), and the group frame is FULL-WIDTH while the visual pill is
   centered/narrower — naive segment math taps empty glass. `core/idb_ui.py`
   probes via `describe-point` (already handled; keep it).
5. **a11y frames are viewport-relative** — `y<0` scrolled past, `y>screen`
   below the fold, tab-bar band occluded. Core's tap guardrail enforces this.
6. **Light-themed apps break pixel-based app detection** — `app_state()`
   greps the a11y tree against `LAUNCHER_LABELS` instead.
7. **The Simulator can be headless** — `simctl`/`idb` work with the window
   hidden/unfocused/on another Space.
8. **First boot after adding a JS dep may crash native** — transitive NATIVE
   modules are NOT autolinked. A `NativeModule: X is null` red box right
   after onboarding is the app's dependency gap, not the tester's fault.
9. **Stale ESLint cache after npm install** — import/no-unresolved ghosts;
   clear the app's ESLint cache.
10. **`simctl openurl` pops an "Open in <app>?" confirm** when invoked from
    outside the app — core auto-approves it; budget polls for slow dialogs.

## Ground-truth layer (`product/qa_api.py`) — port the pattern, not the file

1. Find the app's ground truth (local BE REST, SQLite, a store dump, …). If
   only a remote prod API exists, this layer may not apply — that's fine;
   `qa check` no-ops without the file.
2. Read the schema/serving code FIRST and classify: **real invariants** =
   denormalized state that can drift (counters incremented in place, soft
   references with no FK, pagination merges); **tautological** = computed on
   read (asserting those is worthless — document them so nobody re-adds them).
3. One registry file (`product/INVARIANTS.md`) = IDs + rules + evidence; the
   checker implements exactly the registry; fix both together or neither.
4. Make checks **mode-aware** and report **seeded-vs-live coverage** (a sweep
   over fixtures only exercises read paths — warn when the round created
   nothing).
5. `snapshot`/`diff` delta probes around risky actions (exactly-one-created,
   nothing-ever-disappears, double-submit).

## Not portable, fundamentally

- Invariant rules, scope keywords, rails, TAB/launcher label sets — per app.
- The app's a11y-label conventions — the tester is only as good as the app's
  `accessibilityLabel` coverage (an unfindable element is itself a finding).
- Timed gameplay (sub-3s windows) needs a project `ext/` autoplay layer —
  deliberately not in the engine.

## Smoke test for a fresh onboarding

```bash
scripts/sim-qa/qa doctor      # every FAIL prints its fix; resolves + pins the sim
scripts/sim-qa/qa serve       # owns Metro/dev server, force-reloads the app
scripts/sim-qa/qa health      # exit 0 = all green
scripts/sim-qa/qa tree        # (mobile) labelled elements visible?
scripts/sim-qa/qa init --scope all --label onboarding-smoke
scripts/sim-qa/qa shot home
scripts/sim-qa/qa stop
```

All green → wired. Expect the smoke test itself to surface real app bugs —
prior onboardings found shipping issues on day one.
