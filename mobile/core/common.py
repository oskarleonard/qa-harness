"""Shared primitives for the sim-qa tester. Stdlib only.

Vision: `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot` + a center crop (`sips`) decoded
by a tiny PNG reader.
Input: `idb ui tap` at DEVICE coordinates — same channel as `simctl` (over
the simulator daemon socket).

Both halves are independent of where the Simulator window is on macOS: the
daemon answers regardless of focus / Space / minimize state. The previous
input path used `osascript "click at {x, y}"` (which actually goes through
the macOS Accessibility hierarchy, NOT raw mouse events — so it also
produced synthetic, a11y-mediated taps identical to idb's). That path works
in normal conditions where the Simulator window is on a visible Space, BUT
its window-geometry query (`osascript ... get position of window 1`) can
race against transient window states (mid-launch, briefly minimized, mid
Space transition) and return empty → IndexError, or stale coords → tap
lands on the wrong window. The idb path has no window-state dependency at
all, so those failure modes can't occur.

Tap fidelity is identical between the two: both produce synthetic
UIKit touches that go through the responder chain. Both have the SAME
limitation for `react-native-gesture-handler` gestures (backdrop tap, drag
to dismiss) — see RUNBOOK.md "gorhom bottom-sheets" for the tester-escape
workaround we use for that orthogonal case.
